<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc136">Chapter&#XA0;9</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Interceptors</H1><P>
<A NAME="chap:interceptors"></A></P><P>omniORB supports interceptors that allow the application to insert
processing in various points along the call chain, and in various
other locations. It does not (yet) support the standard Portable
Interceptors API.</P><P>The interceptor interfaces are defined in a single header,
<TT>include/omniORB4/omniInterceptors.h</TT>. Each interception point
consists of a singleton object with <TT>add()</TT> and <TT>remove()</TT> methods,
and the definition of an &#X2018;interceptor info&#X2019; class. For example:</P><DIV CLASS="lstlisting"><B>class</B> omniInterceptors {
  ...
  <B>class</B> clientSendRequest_T {
  <B>public</B>:

    <B>class</B> info_T {
    <B>public</B>:
      GIOP_C&amp;                 giop_c;
      IOP::ServiceContextList service_contexts;

      info_T(GIOP_C&amp; c) : giop_c(c), service_contexts(5) {}

    <B>private</B>:
      info_T();
      info_T(<B>const</B> info_T&amp;);
      info_T&amp; <B>operator</B>=(<B>const</B> info_T&amp;);
    };

    <B>typedef</B> CORBA::Boolean (*interceptFunc)(info_T&amp; info);

    <B>void</B> add(interceptFunc);
    <B>void</B> remove(interceptFunc);
  };
  ...
};</DIV><P>You can see that the interceptors themselves are functions
that take the <TT>info_T</TT> object as their argument and return
boolean. Interceptors are called in the order they are registered;
normally, all interceptor functions return <TT>true</TT>, meaning that
processing should continue with subsequent interceptors. If an
interceptor returns <TT>false</TT>, later interceptors are not
called. You should only do that if you really know what you are doing.</P><P>Notice that the <TT>info_T</TT> contains references to omniORB internal
data types. The definitions of these types can be found in other
header files within <TT>include/omniORB4</TT> and
<TT>include/omniORB4/internal</TT>.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc50"></A><A NAME="htoc137">9.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Interceptor registration</H2><P>All the interceptor singletons are registered within another singleton
object of class <TT>omniInterceptors</TT>. You retrieve a pointer to the
object with the <TT>omniORB::getInterceptors()</TT> function, which
must be called after the ORB has been initialised with
<TT>CORBA::ORB_init()</TT>, but before the ORB is used. The code to
register an interceptor looks, for example, like:</P><DIV CLASS="lstlisting">omniInterceptors* interceptors = omniORB::getInterceptors();
interceptors-&gt;clientSendRequest.add(myInterceptorFunc);</DIV><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc51"></A><A NAME="htoc138">9.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Available interceptors</H2><P>The following interceptors are available:</P><DL CLASS="description"><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>encodeIOR</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when encoding an IOR to represent an object reference. This
interception point allows the application to insert extra profile
components into IORs. Note that you must understand and adhere to the
rules about data stored in IORs, otherwise the IORs created may be
invalid. omniORB itself uses this interceptor to insert various items,
so you can see an example of its use in the
<TT>insertSupportedComponents()</TT> function defined in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/ior.cc</TT>.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>decodeIOR</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when decoding an IOR. The application can use this to get out
whatever information they put into IORs with encodeIOR. Again, see
<TT>extractSupportedComponents()</TT> in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/ior.cc</TT> for an example.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>clientOpenConnection</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called as a client opens a new connection to a server, after the
connection is opened but before it is used to send a request. The
interceptor function can set the <TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>reject</TT> member
to <TT>true</TT> to cause the client to immediately close the new
connection and throw CORBA::TRANSIENT to the calling code. In that
case, the interceptor function can also set the <TT>why</TT> member to
provide a message that is logged.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>clientSendRequest</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called just before a request header is sent over the network. The
application can use it to insert service contexts in the header. See
the <TT>setCodeSetServiceContext()</TT> function in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/cdrStream.cc</TT> for an example of its use.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>clientReceiveReply</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called as the client receives a reply, just after unmarshalling the
reply header. Called for normal replies and exceptions.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>serverAcceptConnection</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when a server accepts a new incoming connection, but before it
reads any data from it. The interceptor function can set the
<TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>reject</TT> member to <TT>true</TT> to cause the
server to immediately close the new connection. In that case, the
interceptor function can also set the <TT>why</TT> member to provide a
message that is logged.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>serverReceiveRequest</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when the server receives a request, just after unmarshalling
the request header. See the <TT>getCodeSetServiceContext()</TT> function in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/cdrStream.cc</TT> for an example.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>serverSendReply</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called just before the server marshals a reply header.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>serverSendException</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called just before the server marshals an exception reply header.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>createRope</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when the ORB is about to create a &#X2018;rope&#X2019; that encapsulates a
bundle of connections (&#X2018;strands&#X2019;) to a remote address space. It allows
application code to override omniORB&#X2019;s normal connection management.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>createIdentity</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called when the ORB is about to create an &#X2018;identity&#X2019; object to
represent a CORBA object. It allows application code to provide its
own identity implementations. It is very unlikely that an application
will need to do this.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>createORBServer</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Used internally by the ORB to register different kinds of server. At
present, only a GIOP server is registered. It is very unlikely that
application code will need to do this.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>createThread</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Called whenever the ORB creates a thread. The <TT>info_T</TT> class for
this interceptor is<DIV CLASS="lstlisting">    <B>class</B> info_T {
    <B>public</B>:
      <B>virtual</B> <B>void</B> run() = 0;
      <B>virtual</B> omni_thread* self() = 0;
    };</DIV><P>The interceptor is called in the context of the newly created thread.
The function <EM>must</EM> call the <TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>run()</TT> method, to
pass control to the thread body. <TT>run()</TT> returns just before the
thread exits. This arrangement allows the interceptor to initialise
some per-thread state before the thread body runs, then release it
just before the thread exits.</P><P>The <TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>self()</TT> method returns a pointer to the
<TT>omni_thread</TT> object for the thread, equivalent to calling
<TT>omni_thread::self()</TT>.</P></DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>assignUpcallThread</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
The ORB maintains a general thread pool, from which threads are drawn
for various purposes. One purpose is for performing upcalls to
application code, in response to incoming CORBA calls. The
<TT>assignUpcallThread</TT> interceptor is called when a thread is
assigned to perform upcalls. In the thread per connection model, the
thread stays assigned to performing upcalls for the entire lifetime of
the underlying network connection; in the thread pool model, threads
are assigned for upcalls on a per call basis, so this interceptor is
triggered for every incoming call<SUP><A NAME="text16" HREF="#note16">1</A></SUP>. As with the <TT>createThread</TT> interceptor, the
interceptor function must call the <TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>run()</TT> method to
pass control to the upcall.<P>When a thread finishes its assignment of processing upcalls, it
returns to the pool (even in thread per connection mode), so the same
thread can be reassigned to perform more upcalls, or reused for a
different purpose.</P></DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>assignAMIThread</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"><BR>
Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI) uses threads to perform outgoing
calls. The <TT>assignAMIThread</TT> interceptor is called when a thread
is assigned to perform AMI calls. As with the other thread
interceptors, the interceptor function must call the <TT>info_T</TT>&#X2019;s
<TT>run()</TT> method to pass control to the AMI call.<P>Unlike the other interceptors, the interceptor functions for
<TT>createThread</TT>, <TT>assignUpcallThread</TT> and
<TT>assignAMIThread</TT> have no return values. Interceptor chaining is
performed by calls through the <TT>info_T::run()</TT> method, rather than
by visiting interceptor functions in turn.</P></DD></DL><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc52"></A><A NAME="htoc139">9.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Server-side call interceptor</H2><P>Calls can be intercepted on the server just before the upcall into
application code. This interceptor is registered with omniORB&#X2019;s
<TT>callDescriptor</TT> class, which is responsible for encapsulating
the state of a call. Unlike the transport-related
<TT>serverReceiveRequest</TT>, <TT>serverSendReply</TT> and
<TT>serverSendException</TT> interceptors, the <TT>callDescriptor</TT>
interceptor is invoked for <EM>all</EM> calls, even ones from colocated
clients in the same address space.</P><P>The types used for the call interceptor are defined in
<TT>include/omniORB4/callDescriptor.h</TT>. The interceptor takes the
form of a bare function with two parameters. The first parameter is a
pointer to the <TT>callDescriptor</TT>; the second is a pointer to
<TT>omniServant</TT>, which is the base class of all servant
classes. The interceptor function must call the
<TT>callDescriptor</TT>&#X2019;s <TT>interceptedCall()</TT> method to pass on the
call.</P><P>This interception point allows access to various parts of omniORB&#X2019;s
call machinery. The <TT>callDescriptor</TT> includes access to the
operation name and, if cast to the concrete subclass defined by the
IDL compiler, the call arguments and return values too.</P><HR CLASS="footnoterule"><DL CLASS="thefootnotes"><DT CLASS="dt-thefootnotes">
<A NAME="note16" HREF="#text16">1</A></DT><DD CLASS="dd-thefootnotes">Except that with the
<TT>threadPoolWatchConnection</TT> parameter set <TT>true</TT>, a thread
can perform multiple upcalls even when thread pool mode is
active.

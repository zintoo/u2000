Changes since omniORB 4.2.0
---------------------------

omniORB 4.2.1 is primarily a bug fix release. See update.log for full
details of changes. Highlights include:

 - Improved Python 3 support.

 - Additional SSL / TLS options.

 - The default DH parameters for TLS are now 2048 bits.

 - More efficient marshalling of messages including large numbers of
   valuetypes.


Changes since omniORB 4.1.x
---------------------------

omniORB 4.2 has a number of new features compared to omniORB 4.1.x,
both large and small. Here are the highlights:

 - Full Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI) support.

 - Support for ZIOP, which compresses large messages.

 - Call timeouts are indicated with the CORBA::TIMEOUT exception,
   rather than CORBA::TRANSIENT (unless suppressed with the
   throwTransientOnTimeout configuration parameter).

 - Servers can be limited to a range of ports to listen on.

 - Performance improvements to Any, sequence buffer management,
   unions, and other areas.

 - Ancient Python versions are no longer supported. omniidl and
   omniORBpy now only work with Python 2.5 or later.

 - omniidl works with Python 3.x as well as 2.x.


Known issues / limitations
--------------------------

This release has the following known issues and omissions:

 - valuetypes supporting local interfaces generate invalid C++. This
   is an issue with the standard C++ mapping.
